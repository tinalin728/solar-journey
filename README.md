**Overview** 🚀  
This project lets users explore planets through an interactive scrolling experience. Each planet loads as a 3D model using model-viewer, and clicking a planet opens a modal with structured information and fun facts. The project also fetches real solar flare data using the NASA DONKI API to display recent solar activity. The focus is on smooth transitions, responsive layout, and a lightweight 3D experience without relying on a full WebGL engine.
